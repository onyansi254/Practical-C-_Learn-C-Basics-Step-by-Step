# Practical C++: Learn C++ Basics Step by Step
Welcome to Practical C++, a repository designed to help you understand the fundamentals of C++ programming and improve your coding practices.

Best Practices in C++
Follow Naming Conventions

Use consistent and descriptive naming styles (e.g., camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes).
Keep names concise yet meaningful.
Choose Meaningful Names

Variables, functions, and classes should have names that clearly indicate their purpose.
Avoid ambiguous or cryptic names.
Leverage the Standard Library (std)

Use the C++ Standard Library whenever possible to ensure efficient and reliable code.
Examples: std::vector, std::string, std::map.
Avoid Redundancy

Stick to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to reduce duplication in your code.
Refactor common patterns into reusable functions or classes.
Keep It Simple

Write code that is clean and easy to understand.
Avoid overcomplicating solutions when simpler alternatives exist.
Use Search Engines

Donâ€™t hesitate to search for solutions, documentation, or examples on Google, Stack Overflow, or C++ reference sites.
